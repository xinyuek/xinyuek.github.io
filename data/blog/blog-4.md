# An Art Historical Analysis of Travelling Chocolate Service

Artwork can reflect the evolution of society, and the artworks of the European period are closely related to the social and cultural context of that time. For instance, lots of the culture and art business was based on entertainment and invention during the eighteenth century, and Mimi Hellman points out a significant idea of the object-as-narrator which can prove the important role of decorative artworks in the social life of eighteenth-century France. Exploring the artwork named *Travelling Chocolate Service* may provide a unique understanding of the lifestyle of the eighteenth-century French.

## Description of the Artwork

This travelling chocolate service is one kind of *Nécessaire de voyage*. It is composed of two main components, the first part is a storage box with a drawer, it is mainly made of wood, the exterior is wrapped with red leather, and some brass parts on the surface like hinges, handles, locks, and keys. The interiors are covered by blue fabric with elaborate gold stitching. The other part is a set of chocolate-making tools and tableware: a porcelain mug with a lid, a pair of porcelain mugs and plates to match, a pair of glasses with lids, a silver jug with a wooden handle, three silver spoons, and a set of knives and forks with ceramic handles. As a typical travel set, those dishes and tools are compactly placed in individual compartments. The lock is designed to keep storage private and secure.

## Materials and Craftsmanship

This travel set was produced in 1765 and contains a variety of materials and techniques such as porcelain, silver, glass and wood. The porcelain sections were produced by the Mennecy Porcelain Factory and other silvers were made by two silversmiths, François Joubert and Louis Samson II. 

Mennecy porcelain factory was established under the patronage of Louis-François-Anne de Neufville, duc de Villeroy (1695–1766), and specialised in French soft-paste porcelain. This type of porcelain has a smooth surface and a light texture. The pieces for chocolate are decorated with 3D flower patterns and not painted. Those production of tableware is very rarely seen in the Mennecy factory, which mainly makes small figures and colourful decorations. Partly because the Vincennes gained a monopoly power in tableware production in 1745. The other pieces like glass and silver are more on function and portable features, due to the consideration of the special need of *Nécessaire de Voyage*.

## Historical Context of Nécessaire de Voyage

*Nécessaire de Voyage* is a specialized type of box made for travelling and contains the necessary items for the trip. It originally developed at the end of the 14th century and gained popularity in the 18th century. During the reign of Louis XV, travelling and excursions around the world became a respected educational concept and a popular pleasure for young aristocrats. Also, the demand for travel boxes expanded during that period, and the purpose of the travel boxes has also evolved from simple cosmetic functions like shaving and grooming to a diversified use. 

Generally, those boxes will be customized according to the purchaser's personal tastes and requirements. In the luxury stores of Paris, customized items are usually expensive by several times compared to mass-produced products. In that case, those beautiful and expensive boxes also can fully reflect the wealth and social status of their owners, and then turning into a status symbol.

## Chocolate as a Status Symbol

The *Nécessaire de Voyage* is named Travelling Chocolate Service for making chocolate and contains the tools. In this particular era, chocolate is likewise a status symbol. Chocolate was imported from Spanish to French in the mid-sixteenth century. Then it became popular in wealthy social circles in the following decades. In the eighteen-centuries, chocolate became a significant part of French culture, but the production process was complex, and manufacturers were quite few, chocolate was expensive at that time. As a result, the use of authentic chocolates is mainly among the rich people. The pursuit of luxury has led to a new trend of consumption and stimulated a significant transformation of production resources.

## Production and Trade Networks

Generally, the production of these boxes requires collaboration across multiple industries, such as porcelain factories, gold and silver making, cabinetmaking, etc. Thus, some craftsmen cooperated, and their objects were put together and sold as a whole to meet the diverse needs of the wealthy class. Such a mode of design and sale was very prevalent in the eighteenth century and was attributed to the important role of *marchands-merciers* in the transformation of products. 

*Marchands-merciers* are not permitted to make objects, but can provide design ideas and assist or commission artisans to make complex items across categories. These merchants served the elite class and became the bridge between craftsman's production and the elite's demand, to some extent altering the cultural connotations of decoration. With this creative production method, *marchands-merciers* were seen as having a higher social status than artisans.

## Cultural and Social Significance

*Travelling Chocolate Service* as a kind of *Nécessaire de Voyage* is made for the requirements of the wealthy class and elites of 18th century France in terms of travel, refined chocolate, and status symbols. From a commercial perspective, it is an example of converting ordinary handmade items into luxury products that emphasize refined taste and social attributes, which means that those luxurious travel boxes were more collectible than just functional and were usually owned by the elites and wealthy class that had a refined lifestyle.

## Conclusion

The *Travelling Chocolate Service* represents far more than a mere functional object; it embodies the sophisticated lifestyle, international trade networks, and social hierarchies of 18th-century French elite society. Through its intricate craftsmanship, exotic materials, and specialized function, this travel set reveals how luxury objects served as markers of status, taste, and cultural refinement. The collaboration between various artisans and the role of *marchands-merciers* in its creation also illuminate the complex commercial and social networks that supported the luxury goods market of the period.

As both a practical travel necessity and a symbol of aristocratic leisure, this chocolate service demonstrates how material culture can serve as a window into understanding the values, aspirations, and daily practices of historical societies.
