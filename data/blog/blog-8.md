# Renaissance and Contemporary Art: Bridging Past and Present

## Introduction

Renaissance works have deeply influenced contemporary art. By exploring SPECULUM and The Garden of Earthly Delights, the artist team SMACK used digital technology to create a special treatment and re-creation of Bosch's most famous work, Earthly Paradise. SPECULUM not only reflects the inspiration of Renaissance works for contemporary creativity but also promotes communication between old and new cultures. Meanwhile, this paper will explore the contemporary assessment of the value of Renaissance works.

## The Inspiration of Renaissance Works for Contemporary Creativity

Firstly, the works of the Renaissance had a significant impact on contemporary artistic creation in terms of visual presentation. The styles, creative techniques and forms of ancient paintings provide direction and inspiration for new artworks. For example, these two paintings are both triptychs, and both contain three scenes: the Garden of Eden, Paradise, and Hell. SPECULUM uses the same layout as the originals. It replicates a lot of details in the scene, such as the landscape and towers. Moreover, to match the perspective view of the original painting, the SMACK team specifically used a camera with parallel perspective and individually modelled each element. These perspective views and the portrayal of the scenery were inspired by the original.

In addition, inspiration in the expression of the theme is also important. Renaissance had a variety of themes, including religious beliefs, historical events, social morality, etc. Many contemporary artworks are based on the same themes. For instance, The Garden of Earthly Delights has been widely interpreted as a warning and judgment against indulgent sexuality. In SPECULUM, the artist is also criticizing the indulgence of desire in the 21st century. This includes excessive sexuality, indulgent consumer desires, the spread of electronic technology and environmental issues. In addition, some of the meaningful images and symbols created by Renaissance artists are still widely discussed and used in contemporary. In Bosch's painting of the erotic garden, springs and berries serve as the typical symbols of sexuality. These details also have a new presentation in SMACK's description of the garden of the 21st-century superego. The visual elements of the Renaissance have also become the basis for modern artists to study and borrow ideas.

Lastly, the Renaissance emphasized the spirit of humanism, inspiring the artists of that period to explore and express human nature, and arousing the artists' concern for the spiritual world of human beings in contemporary times. Humanist thought emphasizes the dignity of humans and the characteristics of human nature. The Garden of Earthly Delights focuses on human desires, and SPECULUM reinterprets desires, combining them with the characteristics of the new era and exploring the indulgent behaviour that exists in contemporary society. This means that humanist thought still plays an important role in modern creativity.

## Conversation Between Contemporary and Renaissance Works

Historical works are reinterpreted and reused in the creation of contemporary art, which establishes a deep connection between historical and contemporary works. In that case, it has produced many appreciated innovations, like Venice and Milan, both recognize the achievements of contemporary art and have contributed to the cultural growth of the city. However, there are still cities that hold on to ancient art within the historical context of the Renaissance, even resisting exhibiting contemporary art in historical spaces. Florence as a key city of the Renaissance, still has challenges in organizing contemporary art exhibitions. Even contemporary art in the Florence showroom was once attacked.

But there are still positive aspects. For instance, Urs Fischer organized an exhibition in the Piazza della Signoria. He opened the exhibition by placing two wax figures in the middle of the Renaissance classic. The wax figures will melt, creating an echo of the other two sculptures. Fischer's attempt was a big step toward the fusion of modern and Renaissance art, and he wanted to bring more modern aesthetics into the city, which had grown up due to the Renaissance but was thus trapped by it.

## Evaluating the Value of Renaissance Works in Contemporary Context

The value of Renaissance works in contemporary terms depends on the understanding of contemporary people. Therefore, value assessment needs to be discussed in the context of the current social environment. Looking back at the historical development of the Renaissance, changes in genre and form were not entirely innovative. They often achieved transformation by remixing extant content. Many of the innovative creations of the Renaissance originated in the Middle Ages. Many contemporary innovations in aesthetic concepts and shifts in creative forms do not appear suddenly, and thus the value of Renaissance works in contemporary aesthetic concepts is continuously evolving.

## The Digital Renaissance: SMACK's SPECULUM

The digital triptych SPECULUM by the artist collective SMACK represents a fascinating example of how contemporary artists engage with Renaissance masterpieces. By recreating Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights using cutting-edge digital technology, SMACK demonstrates the enduring relevance of Renaissance themes while addressing contemporary concerns.

The technical approach taken by SMACK mirrors the meticulous attention to detail found in Renaissance art. Just as Bosch carefully constructed each element of his triptych with symbolic meaning, SMACK individually modeled each digital character and landscape element. This process reflects a deep understanding and respect for the original work while transforming it into a medium that speaks to contemporary audiences.

The thematic continuity between Bosch's 15th-century warnings about human indulgence and SMACK's 21st-century critique of digital excess, consumerism, and environmental destruction shows how Renaissance humanist concerns remain relevant today. The berries and springs that symbolized sexuality in Bosch's work find new expression in SMACK's digital landscape, demonstrating how artistic symbols can evolve while maintaining their essential meaning.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Art Historical Cities

The relationship between Renaissance heritage and contemporary art creation varies significantly across different cultural contexts. While cities like Venice and Milan have successfully integrated contemporary art into their Renaissance-rich environments, Florence faces unique challenges as the birthplace of the Renaissance.

The resistance to contemporary art in some Renaissance cities reflects deeper cultural questions about preservation versus innovation. When Urs Fischer placed melting wax figures in Florence's Piazza della Signoria, the controversy highlighted the tension between maintaining historical integrity and allowing for cultural evolution. However, such interventions also demonstrate the potential for meaningful dialogue between past and present.

The melting nature of Fischer's wax sculptures creates a poetic metaphor for the relationship between Renaissance and contemporary art – both are subject to time, change, and reinterpretation. This temporal aspect suggests that Renaissance works themselves were once contemporary innovations that challenged existing conventions.

## Conclusion

The relationship between Renaissance and contemporary art is neither simple imitation nor complete departure, but rather a complex dialogue that spans centuries. Through examples like SMACK's SPECULUM and Urs Fischer's interventions, we see how contemporary artists engage with Renaissance themes, techniques, and contexts to create new meanings relevant to today's audiences.

The enduring influence of Renaissance art on contemporary creativity demonstrates the universal and timeless nature of human concerns explored by Renaissance masters. Whether through digital recreation or physical intervention in historical spaces, contemporary artists continue to find in Renaissance works a rich source of inspiration and a framework for examining contemporary issues.

As we move forward, the challenge lies not in choosing between preservation and innovation, but in finding ways to honor the past while allowing for creative evolution. The Renaissance itself was a period of revival and innovation – a lesson that remains relevant for how we approach the relationship between historical and contemporary art today.
